# Optimization-technique-in-MATLAB
A deterministic optimization technique ("fmincon" in MATLAB) is followed for a path travelling from A to B in a shortest way possible and at the same time avoid collision against obstacles.
The problem will be extended soon in 3D space to visualize the working in real time.
A heuristic algorithm will be updated using "Genetic Algorithm" in order to check for better solutions.
The idea of this technique will be extended to a piping inspection robot while passing through pipe bends and elbows.
